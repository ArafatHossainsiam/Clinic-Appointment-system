# Chapter 2 — Literature Review

## 2.1 What Is Online Booking
Online booking refers to the practice of reserving accommodations or services over the internet without visiting a physical office. In modern hospitality and service platforms, guests expect to discover listings, filter by type, location, and price, explore images and amenities, and complete reservations through a guided form that validates inputs and provides immediate feedback. Within the Booking System, these flows are made reliable by centralizing data for listings, customers, reservations, and payment logs in Supabase, while images are uploaded through Cloudinary-backed routes and rendered with a resilient image component that normalizes inputs and guards against failures. The result is a customer experience that is available around the clock, provides instant confirmation, maintains clear and transparent pricing, and streamlines day-to-day management for both guests and administrators.

## 2.2 Types of Online Booking
Online booking spans several models. The most common is business-to-consumer (B2C), where property managers or administrators list accommodations and individual guests book directly via the platform. This model fits hotels, cabins, resorts, venues, and similar rental services, and it benefits from clear inventory presentation and straightforward checkout.

Business-to-business (B2B) extends the concept to agencies or corporate coordinators who reserve on behalf of clients or internal teams. This model demands administrative views, bulk management, and aggregated reporting—capabilities that can build upon the existing admin dashboard foundation and typed Supabase utilities.

A consumer-to-consumer (C2C) marketplace is a natural optional extension. Individual hosts would list spaces while guests book through the same interface. The current service creation and image upload flows provide the baseline, and host identity, verification, and payout features would layer on top to complete the marketplace lifecycle.

A multi‑vendor or marketplace approach generalizes further, allowing multiple administrators to manage their own listings under one platform. The typed data model in Supabase and existing admin primitives are compatible with expanding into this direction, provided access control, onboarding, and billing are introduced. Beyond accommodations, service-based add‑ons—such as vehicles, event spaces, conference rooms, or other bookable resources—can share the same core workflow around dates, guest count, price, and availability.

## 2.3 How Online Booking Conducts
A typical session starts with browsing listings on the home page, where guests see service cards containing the name, type, location, price, rating, and availability. Images are displayed using a dedicated component that accounts for varying URL formats and errors gracefully, ensuring tiles never appear blank and galleries remain navigable.

Filtering and search refine the visible inventory. Users adjust service type, location, and price range within the Search and Filter component, and results update immediately with a clear count of matched accommodations. This feedback loop keeps discovery focused and efficient.

When guests open a service, the detail view presents an image gallery, amenities, and status with quick indicators and subtle animations that clarify transitions without blocking rendering. From there, the booking form collects check‑in and check‑out dates, guest count, and special requests, calculating the total price based on the nightly rate and number of days. Submissions validate inputs and either create a new customer record or reuse an existing one by email to avoid duplicates. The system then creates a reservation linked to the selected service and customer, and records a payment entry that captures the chosen method for future processing.

Confirmation is immediate: toasts and modal updates communicate success, the form closes once processing completes, and the reservation ID is surfaced for reference. On the administrative side, staff manage services, customers, and reservations from the dashboard. They can upload or delete images, edit service data, and update statuses with secure image lifecycle handling through Cloudinary APIs and typed Supabase utilities for data operations. Post‑booking extensions—such as cancellation or reschedule policies, notifications, invoices, and review collection—integrate naturally because routes are stateless and components are modular.

## 2.4 Market Research (Online Booking)
Literature on online booking emphasizes understanding guest demographics to tailor inventory and messaging. Core segments vary by age, origin, travel purpose, budget, device usage, and accessibility needs, with meaningful distinctions between leisure and business travel, and domestic versus international journeys. These traits influence preferred booking windows, sensitivity to price and policy, and expectations around imagery and amenities.

Market size and growth analysis assesses local and regional demand, seasonality, and recovery trends, while tracking mobile booking adoption, short‑term rental growth, and structural drivers like internet penetration and digital payment ubiquity. Competitive landscape studies compare pricing, cancellation policies, amenities, fees, and review scores across direct competitors and online travel agencies, highlighting differentiation through unique inventory, transparent fees, verified imagery, and responsive support.

Guest behavior and trends explore booking windows, length of stay, party size, cross‑device journeys, abandonment reasons, and a preference for flexible policies. Decision drivers consistently include price, reviews, location, and image quality, which makes trustworthy media delivery and accurate metadata essential. Technology advancements bring AI‑assisted search, dynamic pricing, real‑time availability, fraud detection, and chat support into scope; virtual tours can enhance decision confidence, while reliable media pipelines via Cloudinary and typed data modeling via Supabase keep performance stable and interfaces predictable.

Regulatory considerations remain front and center: platforms must comply with GDPR/CCPA for data protection, meet PCI‑DSS obligations for any payment handling, respect local lodging taxes and permits, uphold accessibility standards, and publish fair refund and cancellation policies. Satisfaction and reviews close the loop by tracking CSAT/NPS, enforcing response SLAs, and running post‑stay surveys; aligning images and amenities with reality and maintaining service recovery protocols protects long‑term reputation.

Marketing channels and strategies typically combine SEO for local queries, paid search and retargeting, social proof, and lifecycle email (browse abandon, pre‑arrival, post‑stay). Measuring impact through analytics and controlled experiments guides iteration. Operational metrics—occupancy, average daily rate (ADR), revenue per available room (RevPAR), conversion rate, look‑to‑book ratio, CPC/CPA, refund rates, and repeat bookings—inform pricing and inventory decisions, and provide clear signals about product-market fit and scalability.

## 2.5 Summary
Online booking consolidates discovery, evaluation, and reservation into a responsive, always‑available experience that benefits customers and administrators alike. A reliable implementation pairs clear UI flows with robust media handling, typed data access, and stateless server routes. Multiple booking models—from B2C to marketplace variants—can be supported by layering access control, identity, and reporting on top of a typed Supabase core and Cloudinary image pipeline. Literature underscores the importance of trustworthy imagery, flexible policies, and transparent pricing, all backed by compliance, security, and operational rigor. With modular components and measurable metrics, platforms are well‑positioned to expand features and inventory while preserving performance, reliability, and user trust.
